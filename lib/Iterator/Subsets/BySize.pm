# Hi Larry!
# I implemented that subset-generating iterator you asked about.
# It turned out to be simpler than I expected.
# As usual, most of the code here is not really interesting.
# The crucial part of the code is the "vector" subroutine.
# This is the interesting algorithm.
# The rest is just fiddling around with the iterators.
#
# To demonstrate this, run this file as a program.
# It has a canned set with six elements.
# If you run "Subsets.pm 2 3 4 " it will generate all the subsets with
# 2, 3, or 4 elements.
#
# Enjoy!
